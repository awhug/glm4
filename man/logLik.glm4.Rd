\title{Extract Log-Likelihood}
\usage{
\method{logLik}{glm4}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{any object from which a log-likelihood value, or a
   contribution to a log-likelihood value, can be extracted.}

\item{...}{some methods for this generic function require additional
   arguments.}
}
\value{
Returns an object of class \code{logLik}.  This is a number with at
  least one attribute, \code{"df"} (\bold{d}egrees of \bold{f}reedom),
  giving the number of (estimated) parameters in the model.

  There is a simple \code{print} method for \code{"logLik"} objects.

  There may be other attributes depending on the method used: see the
  appropriate documentation.  One that is used by several methods is
  \code{"nobs"}, the number of observations used in estimation (after
  the restrictions if \code{REML = TRUE}).

\description{
This function is generic; method functions can be written to handle
  specific classes of objects.  Classes which have methods for this
  function include: \code{"glm"}, \code{"lm"}, \code{"nls"} and
  \code{"Arima"}.  Packages contain methods for other classes, such as
  \code{"fitdistr"}, \code{"negbin"} and \code{"polr"} in package
  \href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MASS}{\pkg{MASS}}, \code{"multinom"} in package \href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=nnet}{\pkg{nnet}} and
  \code{"gls"}, \code{"gnls"} \code{"lme"} and others in package
  \href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=nlme}{\pkg{nlme}}.

\details{
\code{logLik} is most commonly used for a model fitted by maximum
  likelihood, and some uses, e.g.\ifelse{latex}{\out{~}}{ }{}by \code{\link[stats]{AIC}}, assume
  this.  So care is needed where other fit criteria have been used, for
  example REML (the default for \code{"lme"}).

  For a \code{"glm"} fit the \code{\link[stats]{family}} does not have to
  specify how to calculate the log-likelihood, so this is based on using
  the family's \code{aic()} function to compute the AIC.  For the
  \code{\link[stats]{gaussian}}, \code{\link[stats]{Gamma}} and
  \code{\link[stats]{inverse.gaussian}} families it assumed that the dispersion
  of the GLM is estimated and has been counted as a parameter in the AIC
  value, and for all other families it is assumed that the dispersion is
  known.  Note that this procedure does not give the maximized
  likelihood for \code{"glm"} fits from the Gamma and inverse gaussian
  families, as the estimate of dispersion used is not the MLE.

  For \code{"lm"} fits it is assumed that the scale has been estimated
  (by maximum likelihood or REML), and all the constants in the
  log-likelihood are included.  That method is only applicable to
  single-response fits.

x <- 1:5
lmx <- lm(x ~ 1)
logLik(lmx) # using print.logLik() method
utils::str(logLik(lmx))

## lm method
(fm1 <- lm(rating ~ ., data = attitude))
logLik(fm1)
logLik(fm1, REML = TRUE)
