Title: Fitting Generalized Linear Models Using Sparse Matrices
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Angus Hughes
Maintainer: Angus Hughes <angus-hughes+glm4@outlook.com>
Description: Fits GLMs with sparse and dense 'Matrix' matrices for memory efficiency. Acts as a wrapper for the 'glm4()' function in the 'MatixModels' package, but adds convenient model inspection methods desined to mimic the functionality associated with the 'glm' function from the 'stats' package, including calculating standard errors, model criteria, coefficient test statistics, etc.
